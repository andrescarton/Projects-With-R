# Credit Risk Analysis
In this mini-project, it is to assess the risk of granting credit to customers
of financial institutions, an increasingly common task nowadays!
The supplied dataset will have several variables and not all of them will be relevant to
model building. My work requires dataset analysis, conversion and
normalization of the variables and then construction of the model.
